# inspiredresults

This repository contains code for the python module used to read measures in
the INSPIRED study and assemble them into a single results file.  The code
should be run using python 3.6.  A requirements.txt file is included for
creating a suitable virtual environment.  As of 13 March 2019 some paths are
hard-coded so this code is not currently portable.
